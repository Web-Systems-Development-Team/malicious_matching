Text boxes do not change the input when change

Text boxes display as decimal (the spec states that they need to be hex)

There seems to be a bug in the scoring system on my branch (unimplemented in master).

Many of the elements are still in the underlying DOM, and they need to be created as part of whatever object calls hexed().

Difficulty remains unimplemented.
